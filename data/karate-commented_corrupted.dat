##	abstract = {
##		Data from a voluntary association are used to construct a new
##		formal model for a traditional anthropological problem, fission
##		in small groups. The process leading to fission is viewed as an
##		unequal flow of sentiments and information across the ties in a
##		social network. This flow is unequal because it is uniquely
##		constrained by the contextual range and sensitivity of each
##		relationship in the network. The subsequent differential sharing
##		of sentiments leads to the formation of subgroups with more internal
##		stability than the group as a whole, and results in fission.
##		The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm allows an accurate prediction
##		of membership in the subgroups and of the locus of the fission to be
##		made from measurements of the potential for information flow across
##		each edge in the network. Methods for measurement of potential
##		information flow are discussed, and it is shown that all appropriate
##		techniques will generate the same predictions.}
